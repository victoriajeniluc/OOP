/**
 * One more example on Dynamic Polymorphism.
 *
 * In this example, we learned about Explicit casting, its syntax and risks involved with it.
 * We also learned about usage of instanceof operator with Explicit Casting.
 *
 * NOTE: Classes Parent and Child are declared in Polymorphism1.java file and these classes are declared with default
 * access modifier and hence are accessible within com.udayan.lec12 package.
 * This class is also declared in com.udayan.lec12 package and hence no issues in accessing Parent and Child classes.
